However, after adapting to the learning methods, they excelled academically. They also started learning full-stack development on their own, completed some projects, and then began their Linux journey, starting with basic commands and small projects. Eventually, they became a Linux system administrator, solving problems for about a year before transitioning into DevOps engineering. They learned about Docker, Kubernetes, Chef, Puppet, and Ansible, eventually becoming a junior DevOps engineer. They then transitioned into cloud computing, primarily working with Google Cloud and obtaining certifications in Oracle Cloud and Google Cloud.
